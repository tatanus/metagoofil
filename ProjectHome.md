Metagoofil is an information gathering tool designed for extracting metadata of public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,docx,pptx,xlsx) belonging to a target company.

The tool will perform a search in Google to identify and download the documents to local disk and then will extract the metadata with different libraries like Hachoir, PdfMiner and others. With the results it will generate a report  with usernames, software versions and servers or machine names that will help Penetration testers in the information gathering phase.

This new version supports local directory scanning

The application has been tested in Linux and OSX.
